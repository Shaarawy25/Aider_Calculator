The React Calculator project is a simple, single-page web application that performs basic arithmetic operations. It originally featured:

* Interactive numeric and operator buttons.
* A real-time calculation display.
* Clean UI with light theme styling.
* Stateless calculation logic using a dedicated `calculate.js` module.

### ✨ **Added Features**

### 🛠️ **Implementation Process**

* Launched Aider in the project directory with the `gemini-1.5-flash` model.
* Used Aider prompts to implement features incrementally:

  * Added Dark Mode through state management and conditional CSS.
  * Created a calculation history state array that updates when calculations complete.
  * Developed the sidebar UI for displaying history.
* Verified functionality through manual browser testing and visual inspections.

### 🚧 **Challenges Faced & Solutions**

| Challenge                             | Solution                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Environment variables not auto-loaded | Used `direnv` for automatic `.env` loading.                 |
| Initial incorrect file paths          | Verified with `ls` and manually adjusted paths for Aider.   |
| Handling state updates safely         | Used functional state updates to avoid asynchronous issues. |
| Ensuring CSS consistency              | Centralized CSS updates and tested across themes.           |
